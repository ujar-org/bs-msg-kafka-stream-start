## 🛠️ Installation

Pre-Requisites to run this example locally

- Setup git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
- Clone source code to the local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KnowHowSpringBoot/quickstart-kafka-stream-initialize.git

cd quickstart-kafka-stream-initialize
```

- Install Docker [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Add new version of Docker Compose [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Spin-up single instance of Kafka broker, ZooKeeper by running command:

```

### Running locally

This application is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built
using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar files and run it from the command line:

- Create jar packages:

```
./mvnw package
```

- Run **quickstart-kafka-stream-initialize** app:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You might also want to use Maven's `spring-boot:run` goal - applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local -P dev
```
